# Cookiecutter for Python Algorithm Development for vantage6

## **This repository is superseded by https://github.com/vantage6/v6-algorithm-template**

*A lean [Cookiecutter template](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for developing algorithms for [vantage6](https://github.com/vantage6/) in Python.*

![cookiecutter_vantage6](multimedia/cookiecutter_x_vantage6.PNG?raw=true "Cookiecutter X vantage6")

## Requirements:
* Python >=3.7
* [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 2.0.0

 Depending on how you manage your Python packages, Cookiecutter can be installed with [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or with [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (as shown in [`conda-forge`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cookiecutter)):

``` bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

## Creating a new algorithm (template)

To create a new algorithm template, run:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/vantage6/cc_algorithm_python

For the sake of brevity, GitHub repositories can just use the `gh` prefix:

    cookiecutter gh:vantage6/cc_algorithm_python

Afterwards, you will be prompted to enter a few values. After inputting each
of them, make sure to type `enter`:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `algorithm_name` | Name of the algorithm |
| `repo_name`  | Name of the (GitHub) repository. Please use [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). Spaces and dashes will be replaced by underscores (`_`). |
| `author_name`  | Your name (or your organization, company, or team) |
| `description` | A short description of the algorithm. Please include the core details of your algorithm (e.g., if it for [horizontally- or vertically-partitioned data](https://vantage6.ai/documents/7/moncada-torres2020vantage6_57GU4Gt.pdf), if it is an [MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) algorithm, etc. |
| `open_source_license` | The software license for your project (more information below). |

## Licenses
Currently, you can choose from three different licenses when creating your
algorithm template:

* [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
* [Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)
* [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)
* (No license)

#### Adding more licenses *to the template*
If you are interested in adding more licenses *to the template*:

* See [`choosealicense.com`](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) (or any other
  resource) and choose the license that is appropriate for your use case.
* Go to `cookiecutter.json` and add the license name to the `open_source_license` list.
* Go to `setup.py` and add the license to the `license` string in `setup`.
* Go to `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/LICENSE` and copy-paste the license text in its
corresponding `if`.
* In the license text, change the important fields to [Jinja delimiters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/) (e.g., `<year>` to ` {% now 'utc', '%Y' %}`; `<author name>` to `{{ cookiecutter.author_name }}`)


## Directory structure
The resulting directory structure for your algorithm is as follows:

```
├── algorithm_name     <- The core files of your algorithm.
│   └── __init__.py
│   └── central.py     <- Functions for the server. Former master.py.
│   └── remote.py      <- Functions for the nodes (which have access to the data).
|                         Former rpc.py.
│
├── docs               <- A default Sphinx project for documenting your algorithm.
|                         See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ for more details.
|                         We suggest that the documentation includes at least
|                         the following sections:
|                          - Introduction
|                          - Algorithm (mathematical) description
|                          - Validation
│
├── examples           <- Examples of how to use the algorithm in the
|   |                     shape of Jupyter notebooks. The suggested naming
|   |                     convention is a number (for ordering), the creator's
|   |                     initials, and a short description, (e.g., `01_xyz_running_the_algorithm`).
|   |                     We also recommend you take a look into using jupytext.
│   └── 01_xyz_running_the_algorithm.ipynb
│
├── tests              <- Functions for testing your algorithm.
│   └── test_environment.py   
│
├── .gitignore
|
├── Dockerfile
|
├── LICENSE            <- If chosen, the appropriate license file.

├── README.md          <- The top-level README for users of the algorithm.
|                         Make sure to provide a helpful description.
|                         Including a Quick Start guide is encouraged.
|
├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the algorithm
|                         environment. This can be generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
│
├── setup.py           <- Makes the algorithm pip installable (pip install -e .)
|                         so algorithm_name can be imported.
│
└── tox.ini            <- tox file with settings for running tox.
                          See https://tox.wiki/
